# Telecom-Users
* I got the Telecom-Users dataset from the kaggle platform, but when I look at kaggle, the dataset is no longer displayed.

* I built basic data visualizations and a multiple linear regression model using the Telecom-Users dataset.

* I made Churn Analysis by using visualizations methods as well as, SVM and. KNN Algorithms.
